> An online powerful launchpad project

## What is it about

![Gif demo](demo.gif)

The goal here is to provide a simple online launchpad. In the end, it will allow you to load your own sounds, search sounds form internet sources such as YouTube and Soundcloud and sample these sounds. We will also allow you to connect a MIDI device to control the online interface!

## How to use
